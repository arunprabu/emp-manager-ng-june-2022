  /* 3 Challenges or Disadvantages of Testing with Direct API request 
    1. time consuming 
    2. backend might not be stable / may still be in development 
    3. data inconsistencies may be there 

    So, we are NOT going to send real ajax requests from out test spec. 
    Solution is to mock -- Let's go with MOCKING API CALLS
