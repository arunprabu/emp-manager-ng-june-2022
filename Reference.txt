Components
---
Thinking in Angular
---
  1. Identify number of components 
  2. Identify the hierarchy of components


Building Blocks

  Components  
    HTML, CSS, TS (Data Binding)
  Directives 
  Services 
  Interfaces / Classes / Models 
  Pipes
  Guards
  Modules 
  Interceptor

Project Structure - Feature-wise and building block-wise project structure

Styles in Angular
--
  1. External Styles 
      bootstrap.css, styles.css, app.comp.css 
  2. Internal Styles 
      will be inside @Component decorator (refer footer.comp.ts )
  3. Inline Styles 
      use style attribute in html element directly 
---

ViewEncapsulation and styling 
--
In Angular, a component's styles can be encapsulated within the component's host element so that 
they don't affect the rest of the application.
Refer: https://angular.io/guide/view-encapsulation

Routing in Angular (~1.5 Hours)
---
  * to make a single page app 

  SPA Characteristics (70):
  1. Pages should not refresh/reload [DONE]
  2. URL should be changed [DONE]
  3. History should be maintained [DONE]
  4. Header, Footer should be intact  [DONE]
  5. The section in between header and footer should be updated [DONE]
  6. Active Menu should be set [TODO]
  7. Page Title should be changed [TODO]

Routing 
---
  Step 0:
  --
    Identifying the URLs for Menus 
      Home                - http://localhost:4200/
      Concepts            - http://localhost:4200/concepts
      Employees           - http://localhost:4200/employees
      About               - http://localhost:4200/about

  Step 1:
  ---
    Let's create the components for the URL's 

    ng g c home -is -it 
    ng g c concepts -is 
    ng g c employees -is 
    ng g c about -is 
    

  Step 2:
  ---
     LEt's setup the URL's in menu.comp.html 

  Step 3: 
  --
    Check the URL. URL will change. But not stable. Let's fix it. 
    Now, it's time to config the routes in app-routing.module.ts 

    // Config the routes 
    const routes: Routes = [
      { path: '', component: HomeComponent},
      { path: 'concepts', component: ConceptsComponent },
      { path: 'employees', component: EmployeesComponent},
      { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }
    ];

  Step 4:
  ---
    Check the app. URLs will be stable. But the component is loaded in between header and footer. 
    Let's fix it. 

    in app.comp.html, use router-outlet in between header and footer

    <!-- Ideal place for your layout -->
    <app-header></app-header>

    <div class="container mt-5 pt-2">
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </div>

    <app-footer></app-footer>  

  Step 5:
  --
    Check the app. Page will still refresh. Let's fix it.

    in menu.comp.html -- replace all href with routerLink

  Step 6:
  --
    Let's work on active menu [TOMORROW]


Variables, methods, classes and Casing 
---
  1. camelCase  [ Recommended for Variables and methods ]
  2. PascalCase [ Recommended for Class, Interfaces, Components, Directives, Services, Guards, Pipes, Modules ]
  3. kebab-case [ Recommended sometimes for css classes ]
  4. snake_case [ Not Recommended ] 

valid variable names 
-
appName 

valid boolean names 
-
isLoggedIn, hasAuth

valid array names 
-
  colors, colorList 

valid object names 
-
  profileData, profile, 





Data Binding (~4 Hours)
---
  Binding the data from comp.ts into comp.html 

  TS => HTML 

  1. Interpolation
        TS => HTML 
        {{}} 

  2. Property Binding 
        TS => HTML 
        []

  3. Event Binding 
        TS <= HTML 
        ()
        Note: 'on' prefix should be removed from event 

        TODO: in events 

  4. Two Way Binding 
        TS <=> HTML 
        [(ngModel)]

        Note: applicable in form elements only 

  5. Custom Property Binding 
  6. Custom Event Binding 


===
Cross Component Communication
--
  1. Parent to Child Component Communication
      Using Custom Property Binding 

  2. Child to Parent Component Communication
      2.1 Using Custom Event Binding 
      2.2 Using @ViewChild() [TODO] 

  3. Any to Any Component Communication
      Using RxJS/Observable 
      Prereq: Services, RxJS/Observables, Subscription, LifeCycle Hooks 





Directives
---
  * special instructions to the DOM 

  1. Attribute Directives (will continue to learn many more)
      * manipulates the behavior of the el 
      routerLink

  2. Structural Directives 
      * manipulates the structural layer. 

        *ngIf
        *ngFor 
        ngSwitch [TODO]

  3. Custom Attribute Directives 

  4. Custom Structural Directives [TODO]
