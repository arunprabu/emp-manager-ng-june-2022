Styles in Angular
--
  1. External Styles 
      bootstrap.css, styles.css, app.comp.css 
  2. Internal Styles 
      will be inside @Component decorator (refer footer.comp.ts )
  3. Inline Styles 
      use style attribute in html element directly 
---

ViewEncapsulation and styling 
--
In Angular, a component's styles can be encapsulated within the component's host element so that 
they don't affect the rest of the application.
Refer: https://angular.io/guide/view-encapsulation

Routing in Angular (~1.5 Hours)
---
  * to make a single page app 

  SPA Characteristics (70):
  1. Pages should not refresh/reload [DONE]
  2. URL should be changed [DONE]
  3. History should be maintained [DONE]
  4. Header, Footer should be intact  [DONE]
  5. The section in between header and footer should be updated [DONE]
  6. Active Menu should be set [TODO]
  7. Page Title should be changed [TODO]

Routing 
---
  Step 0:
  --
    Identifying the URLs for Menus 
      Home                - http://localhost:4200/
      Concepts            - http://localhost:4200/concepts
      Employees           - http://localhost:4200/employees
      About               - http://localhost:4200/about

  Step 1:
  ---
    Let's create the components for the URL's 

    ng g c home -is -it 
    ng g c concepts -is 
    ng g c employees -is 
    ng g c about -is 
    

  Step 2:
  ---
     LEt's setup the URL's in menu.comp.html 

  Step 3: 
  --
    Check the URL. URL will change. But not stable. Let's fix it. 
    Now, it's time to config the routes in app-routing.module.ts 

    // Config the routes 
    const routes: Routes = [
      { path: '', component: HomeComponent},
      { path: 'concepts', component: ConceptsComponent },
      { path: 'employees', component: EmployeesComponent},
      { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }
    ];

  Step 4:
  ---
    Check the app. URLs will be stable. But the component is loaded in between header and footer. 
    Let's fix it. 

    in app.comp.html, use router-outlet in between header and footer

    <!-- Ideal place for your layout -->
    <app-header></app-header>

    <div class="container mt-5 pt-2">
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </div>

    <app-footer></app-footer>  

  Step 5:
  --
    Check the app. Page will still refresh. Let's fix it.

    in menu.comp.html -- replace all href with routerLink

  Step 6:
  --
    Let's work on active menu [TOMORROW]


Variables, methods, classes and Casing 
---
  1. camelCase  [ Recommended for Variables and methods ]
  2. PascalCase [ Recommended for Class, Interfaces, Components, Directives, Services, Guards, Pipes, Modules ]
  3. kebab-case [ Recommended sometimes for css classes ]
  4. snake_case [ Not Recommended ] 

valid variable names 
-
appName 

valid boolean names 
-
isLoggedIn, hasAuth

valid array names 
-
  colors, colorList 

valid object names 
-
  profileData, profile, 





Data Binding (~4 Hours)
---
  Binding the data from comp.ts into comp.html 

  TS => HTML 

  1. Interpolation
        TS => HTML 
        {{}} 

  2. Property Binding 
        TS => HTML 
        []

  3. Event Binding 
        TS <= HTML 
        ()
        Note: 'on' prefix should be removed from event 

        TODO: in events 

  4. Two Way Binding 
        TS <=> HTML 
        [(ngModel)]

        Note: applicable in form elements only 

  5. Custom Property Binding 
  6. Custom Event Binding 


===
Cross Component Communication
--
  1. Parent to Child Component Communication
      Using Custom Property Binding 

  2. Child to Parent Component Communication
      2.1 Using Custom Event Binding 
      2.2 Using @ViewChild() [TODO] 

  3. Any to Any Component Communication
      3.1) Using RxJS/Observable 
          Prereq: Services, RxJS/Observables, Subscription, LifeCycle Hooks 
      
      3.2) Using Redux or NgRx 
          Prereq: Flux Pattern 



Directives
---
  * special instructions to the DOM 

  1. Attribute Directives (will continue to learn many more)
      * manipulates the behavior of the el 
      routerLink

  2. Structural Directives 
      * manipulates the structural layer. 

        *ngIf
        *ngFor 
        ngSwitch [TODO]

  3. Custom Attribute Directives 

  4. Custom Structural Directives [TODO]

Setting up ESLint in Angular
---
  in command prompt exec the following command 

  ng add @angular-eslint/schematics

  Would you like to proceed? Yes 
  
  Then, wait for the following messages to appear in cmd prompt 
  
  CREATE .eslintrc.json (984 bytes)
  UPDATE package.json (1488 bytes)
  UPDATE angular.json (3574 bytes)
  ✔ Packages installed successfully.

  You are all set.

dev => qa => (bugs) => dev => qa => (bugs) => dev => qa => (bugs) => dev => qa => (QA PASSED) => Deployment 


Modern Approach of Software Development 
----------
dev writes test cases => dev writes functionality => (TOOLS) => instant feedback of success/failure 

calc 
--
  Developers: 
  ---
    Source: FRD, HLD, Mockups 
    Prepare: Test Cases (Real Requirements)
    ---
      1. inputs should be numbers 
      2. output should always be number
      3. if wrong input entered add button should be disabled 

    Project Features: ADD 
    --  
      function add(a: number, b: number): number {
        return a + b;
      }

      add(10, 20); // 30 

    Testing: Tools 
    ----


Modern Software Dev Methodology of 2022 / Testing Approach 
---
  1. Test Driven Development (TDD)
      * is a progamming practice that instructs the developers to 
        write NEW code only if an automated test has failed 

      devs write test cases => (Instant feedback of failure/bug) => devs write the functionality =>  (Instant feedback of success ) => [CODE COMPLETE ]

      Testing Pattern: AAA (Act, Arrange, Assert )
      Tools: JEST, Mocha, Chai 

  2. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) - [ Followed Be JasmineJS ]
     * is an agile s/w dev Methodology
     * an app documented and designed around the behavior, the uses expects to experience 
        when interacting with it. 

      devs write test cases => (Instant feedback of failure/bug) => devs write the functionality =>  (Instant feedback of success ) => [CODE COMPLETE ]
      Testing Pattern: Given, When, Then
      Tools: Jasmine JS 


Automated Testing 
---
  * writing code to test our code using tools is automated testing 

  0. Static Type Checking 
      Tools: TypeScript

  1. Unit Testing [LEARN]
      * Testing small unit of components, services, directives, pipes, etc 
      * Testing the comp in isolation (without connecting with the rest api )
      * Testing Individual units of the component 
      * Bug Reduction Density: 40-80% 

      Tools: [Jasmine JS, Karma ]
      Jasmine JS - Unit Testing Framework
      Karma - Test Runner 

  2. Integration Testing 
      * Different units, modules, or components tested as combined entity 
      * Behavior of the app would be tested 
      * Used for exposing issues in the integration of multiple units 

      Example: test if a child comp can update parent comp 

      Tools: [Jasmine JS, Karma]

  3. End to End Testing (E2E Testing)
      * Testing the whole app 
      * Usually a multi step test combining multiple units and integration tests into 
        one big test 
      * Tests are done in a simulated browser, there may or many not an UI while test the 
        is running 
      
      Example: Testing the complete auth flow 

      Tools: [Protractor or CypressJS or Selenium]

Forms in Angular
---
  1. Template Driven Forms 
      * made with html 
      * easiest type of form 
      * validations are performed with directives 
      disadv 
      ---
        * not suitable for complex form validations 
        * not suitable for unit testing

  2. Reactive Forms [RECOMMENDED]
      * made with html + ts 
      * easy 
      * validations are performed with built-in and custom Validators

      adv 
      ---
        * suitable for complex form validations 
        * suitable for unit testing

Service in Angular 
---
  * Intermediate layer helping the comp connect with REST API 
  * job of a service  
      * getting the req from the comp 
      * send the req to the rest api 
      * fetching res from the rest api 
      * sending the res to the comp 

  * building block in angular

Feature Modules and Feature Routing Modules
--
  Step 1: 
    --
    create feature module 
      ng g m products/employees --flat -m=app 

  Step 2: 
    create feature routing module 
      ng g m employees/employees-routing --flat -m=employees 

---
ng g c products/components/products-list -s 
ng g c products/components/products-details -s -t
